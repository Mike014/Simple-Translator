# Project Summary: Translation Application

## Application Description
The application is a simple translator based on Django that allows users to input text in Italian and get a translation in English. The application uses Google Translate to perform the translation and displays the result on a separate page.

## Technologies Used
- **Django**: Web framework used to build the application.
- **Googletrans**: Python library to interface with the Google Translate API.
- **Spacy**: Natural language processing library used to load Italian and English language models.
- **HTML/CSS**: Used to build the user interface.

## File Structure
- **`result.html`**: HTML page that displays the translation result.
- **`settings.py`**: Django configuration file that contains the project settings.
- **`translate.html`**: HTML page that contains the form for inputting the text to be translated.
- **`translation_project/urls.py`**: URL configuration file for the main project.
- **`translator/urls.py`**: URL configuration file for the `translator` application.
- **`views.py`**: File that contains the views for the `translator` application.

## Main Features
- **Text Translation**: Users can input text in Italian and get a translation in English.
- **Simple User Interface**: The application offers a simple and intuitive user interface for inputting text and viewing the translation result.

## How It Works
1. The user inputs text in Italian on the `translate.html` page.
2. The text is sent to the Django server via a POST request.
3. The `translate_text` view in `views.py` uses Google Translate to translate the text from Italian to English.
4. The translation result is displayed on the `result.html` page.
